Terminal-based or CLI (Command-Line Interface) CRUD application. This project is used for recording personal patient record and with this user can manage database in a simple way of using Create, Read, Update, and Delete features.

## Getting Started
To get started with this application, you need to have Python 3 installed on your machine. You can download and install from [Official Python Website](https://www.python.org/downloads/). For text editor or IDE, you can install VSCode from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download).

## Dependencies
This is a modified CRUD Application from the previous version of this [repository](https://github.com/reyharighy/Integrating-CRUD-Application-with-CSV-Files-using-CLI-in-Python) with 'data.pickle' file is used as storage format and some built-in modules that provide various functions and tools for different purposes.

## Usage
Just a friendly reminder. Create a single folder where 'data.pickle' and 'Patient_Record_Caps_Project.py' are stored together and add the folder as a workspace in order for the application to successfully load the data.
