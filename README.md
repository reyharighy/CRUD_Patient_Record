# CRUD_Patient_Record
Terminal-based CRUD application.
This project is used for recording personal patient record and with this user can manage database in a simple way of using Create, Read, Update, and Delete features.
Just a friendly reminder. Add folder where data.pickle and CRUD_Patient_Record.py stored as a workspace in order for the terminal to load the data.pickle.
